# Pypol with Python

## Overview of Election Audit
After submitting our original python script for the elecion results for the candidates, the election commission requested that we glean additional information from the raw data about the election looking more closely at county participation. Specifically, we were asked to find out the voter turnout for each county along with the percentage of votes cast from each county. Furthermore, the election commision asked us to determine the county with highest turnout. 

## Election Audit Results
We were able to alter the original script to gather specific analysis including the following:
  - There were a total of 369,711 votes cast in this Congressional Election
  - Calculated the total number of votes cast in each county as well as the percentage of the total votes for each county in the district
    - Arapahoe County: 24,801 (6.7%)
    - Denver County: 306,055 votes (82.8%)
    - Jefferson County: 38,885 votes (10.5%)
  - With over four-fifths of the votes casts, Denver County had the most votes in this election
  - Calculated the total number of votes cast for each candidate as well as each candidates percentage of the total votes in the district
    - Diana DeGette: 272,892 votes (73.8%)
    - Raymon Anthony Doane: 11,606 votes (3.1%)
